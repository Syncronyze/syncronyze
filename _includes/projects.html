      <h3> Manitoba Association of Foodbanks </h3>
      <p>A PHP-based web application designed to solve the issue of the foodbanks needing to monitor community statistics for their yearly report. </p> <p>Previously, receiving food wasn't so easy-- you had to be crossed off of the foodbank's list, a list that required your Manitoba Health ID. The web app solved this issue by making an easy, fast, private and secure way for staff to search clients. A web application was chosen due to the ease at which you can access the contents, with a central server, the staff can login using their smartphone or any other internet device at any time. With other suggested solutions, they may have had the individual foodbanks buy expensive technologies to store data. </p>

      <h3> Andromeda </h3>
      <p>A map with extremely easy gameplay set in a distant, foreign moon.</p><p>Andromeda's colour scheme is one that is unique among the current surf maps, and a theme that hasn't really been fully explored previously. Though an easy map, it has become a staple of the surf community and is favourites amongst all skill levels.</p>

      <p>A <b>m</b>o<b>d</b>e<b>rn</b> theme that features challenging, tighter, low speed surf.</p><p>Known mostly for its ridiculously precise and difficult bonus 4 made by Beetle179, the map itself was created with me written all over it, featuring one of my personal favourite colour schemes with a surf style that I personally find a lot of fun.</p>

      <p> An infinite space-scroller game, think arcade space scroller. It has a fully automated backdrop that is procedurally generated with unique controls that could be used on a phone.
