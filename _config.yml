user_description: I enjoy creating exciting websites, learning new technologies, and in addition, I also design and create levels for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/4cfyqn/whats_the_deal_with_csgo_surfing_why_do_people/d1i0acj/">surfing</a>. While I prefer to develop websites due to their innante accessibility where anyone, anywhere can view and use them, anything coding-related has my interest piqued.
